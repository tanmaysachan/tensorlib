# Tensorlib

That's it. Tensorlib == tensor library.

### Expectations
1. Somewhat fast, on macs atleast.
3. Somewhat educational, with clean code (gripe with ggml).

### Dreams
1. Capable of loading an LLM.
2. Trainable, with 0 dependencies.
3. Support for acceleration on more hardware.

### Usage
1. Make sure metal compiler is installed.
2. `make DEBUG=1 RUN_METAL=1` or `make DEBUG=1 RUN_METAL=1 rebuild` for a fresh build.
